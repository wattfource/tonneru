//! Reusable UI component helpers
//!
//! This module contains helper functions for creating consistent UI elements.
//! Currently most rendering is done directly in mod.rs, but these helpers
//! are available for future refactoring.

// Components are currently inlined in mod.rs for simplicity.
// This module is reserved for future UI component extraction.
